# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on blog portion of portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Was able to get blog list view working (reading data from Firebase Firestore). Began coding blog post detail view but hit a wall. More to come tomorrow.

- [blogPosts.js](Code/Day_001/blogPosts.js)

- [nav_list.js](Code/Day_001/nav_list.js)

### Day 2: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on blog post detail page of portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** User can now click on a blog post on the list view and will be brough to the detail view. Going to detail view performs a new query to select specific blog post via ID.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
